  Project Euler Problem 39
  Mikael Fors 2014

  "If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides,
   {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

   For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?"

/*
    a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = c ^ 3, where a + b c = 1000 at most means that
    a,b must be less than 293 because math.sqrt(2 * 293 ^ 2) + 2 * 293 = 1000

    This means roughly 85k potential side combinations (291 * 292), which is
    clearly low enough for brute force.

    We could generalize the function below by performing the calculation step
    done on the input argument, but depending on the roof-value for p, brute
    force might become a less than ideal approach.
